## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```
library(knitr)
library(leaflet)
library(dplyr)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```
m <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lat=15.3350, lng=76.4600, popup="Hampi, Karnataka") %>%
  addMarkers(lat=14.5479,lng=74.3188, popup="Gokarna,Karnataka") %>%
  addMarkers(lat=15.2361,lng=74.6173, popup="Dandeli,Karnataka") %>%
  addMarkers(lat=14.0940,lng=74.4899, popup="Murdeshwar,Karnataka")
```
```
plot(m)
```
##Mapping clusters

```
df <- data.frame(lat=runif(500, min=14.09, max = 15.33 ),
                 lng=runif(500, min=74.31, max = 76.46 )) 
```
```
df %>%
leaflet() %>%
addTiles() %>%  
addMarkers(clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
```
```
plot(df)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
